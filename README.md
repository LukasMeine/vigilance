## About the project
This project was born from a need we were having to have a consistent, easy to install and maintain wrapper to the existent code beautifiers available on the market. We found the amazing [Atom beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) package while looking for such solution, but it required an enourmous amount of effort to configure locally, and we found no alternative when we wanted to use it as a service.

## So, what is this?
This is an api coded in node.js that wraps a lot of existent code beautifiers. It's purpose is to be easy to install, use and maintain. You can run it locally to use it on any open source existent IDE ( Atom examples are coming soon! ) or deploy it on a server to use it as a service.

## Use cases

[Devmind.io](https://devmind.io) Uses this project to beautify their user's code with the click of a button
